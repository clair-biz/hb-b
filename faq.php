          Is home delivery available?

      <div class="collapsible-body">
          <span style="">
              Delivery is the biggest problem for home based businesses to cross the limits of service.
              HomeBiz has solved this problem by making delivery option available as marginally extra cost through our delivery partner.
              As of now delivery is available within Pune and Pimpri-chinchwad area only.

          What are the delivery charges?

      </div>
      <div class="collapsible-body">
          <span style="">
              Delivery charge varies with each Seller.<br />
              Sellers incur relatively higher shipping costs on low value items.
              In such cases, charging delivery charge helps them offset logistics costs.
              Please check your order summary to understand the delivery charges for individual products.
